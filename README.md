# SOLoP

## Introduction
**SOLoP** ( Stack-Orientated Language of Programming ) is a simplistic stack-based programming language written in Python. It uses symbols to denote simple commands, and has a mostly easy learning curve. For procedures and commands, reverse-polish notation ( also called postfix notation ) is used, making it easier to perceive how the stack will be affected by a given command. SOLoP is more of an experiment than an actual product, made and designed in about a week. I guess it could be used for golf-scripting or just be considered an esoteric programming language ( though I would not consider it to be one.)
